<p>I'm a digital writer, artist, developer of creative web apps and practice-based researcher. In my creative practice and research I specialise in character-driven interactive digital narratives that adapt to reader choice and have the potential to move and transform people. This involves developing original ludonarrative techniques (where story and gameplay entwine) to model convincing characters with apparent psychological depth.</p>

<p>As postdoctoral researcher-creator for <span>Writing New Body Worlds</span>, an international, transdisciplinary <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/writingnewbodies/home?authuser=0">research project</a> , funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, I am currently creating an interactive digital fiction for body image bibliotherapy. It will be published in 2022 as a progressive web app (PWA) for desktop and mobile devices.</p>

<p>I'm also creating an interactive psychological thriller narrative called <span>Stitched Up</span>. This work-in-progress began life as part of my creative practice-based PhD in Digital Writing at Bath Spa University. During which, I also built an early prototype version of my original interactive narrative engine, the <i>Conversengine</i>, and my custom-built authoring tool, the <i>Convowriter</i>. My PhD thesis is entitled: <i>Stitched Up</i> in The <i>Conversengine</i>: Using Expressive Processing and Multimodal Languages to Create a Character-Driven Interactive Digital Narrative.</p>

<p>I created the majority of my earlier works of interactive storytelling and playable media in Flash. My digital fiction, <i>Underbelly</i>, won
the <a target="_blank" href="http://newmediawritingprize.co.uk/?page_id=350">New Media Writing Prize 2010</a> and the
MaMSIE Digital Media Competition 2011. My work is published in online journals and anthologies, including the

	and has been presented at international festivals, exhibitions and conferences. You can also see these works in my <span>Flash E-Lit Archive</span>. From 2007 to 2013 I was a core member of the digital arts remixing collective, <span>Remixworx</span>, and contributed over 100 remixes. Before working in digital media and web technologies, I made short films, videos, animations, installations and wrote fiction and screenplays.</p>

<p>I have a PhD in Digital Writing from Bath Spa University, an MA in Creative Writing and New Media from De Montfort University and an MA in Fine Art from Cardiff Institute of Higher Education.</p>

<p>My creative media & technical skills include:</p>
<ul>
