In our world of perpetual connectivity, touching interfaces that keep us out of reach, we form attachments whilst remaining detached, by turns kindling and dampening emotions. A triptych of animated and interactive digital poems for the web and/or live performance.

<cite>Out of Touch</cite> (the original piece) was commissioned by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art for the <cite>Third Hand Plays</cite> series, curated by Brian Kim Stefans, published at SFMOMA's Open Space in Summer 2011.
