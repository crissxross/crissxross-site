title: Out of Touch
description: >-
  In our world of perpetual connectivity, touching interfaces that keep us out
  of reach, we form attachments whilst remaining detached, by turns kindling
  and dampening emotions. 'Out of Touch' includes a suite of animated and
  interactive digital poems for the web and live performance.

In our world of perpetual connectivity, touching interfaces that keep us out of reach, we form attachments whilst remaining detached, by turns kindling and dampening emotions. A suite of animated and interactive digital poems for the web and/or live performance.

'Out of Touch' was commissioned by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art for the Third Hand Plays series, curated by Brian Kim Stefans, published at SFMOMA's Open Space in Summer 2011. In the original Flash poem, the text randomly generated so every viewing was a unique experience.
