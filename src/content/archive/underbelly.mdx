title: Underbelly
description: >-
  An award-winning playable story about a woman sculptor, carving on the site
  of a former colliery in the north of England. As she carves, she is
  disturbed by a medley of voices, some from the site's dark industrial past,
  and the player/reader is plunged into an underworld of repressed fears and
  desires.
