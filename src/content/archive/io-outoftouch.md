Variations of 'Out of Touch' - a suite of digital works I made for live performance. Touching interfaces that keep us out of reach yet perpetually connected and forever desiring...

After making the original 'Out of Touch' piece for San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's Open Space, I developed the ideas further, in 'Out of Hand' and 'Out of Sight', to create a collection of playable media for live digital performance. 'Out of Hand' references the disclosures of Edward Snowden that came to light in 2013.
