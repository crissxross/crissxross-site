description: >-
  Remixworx (aka R3M1XW0RX) was a collaborative creative space for remixing visual poetry,
  e-poetry, playable media, animation, art, music, spoken word, texts and
  more. Initiated by Randy Adams (1951-2014) in 2006, it grew to number more
  than 500 individual creative works. I was an active member from 2007 to 2013
  and contributed more than 100 works, mainly in Flash.
