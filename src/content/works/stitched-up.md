An interactive psychological thriller, featuring a 'Dude' rather than a 'Damsel' in distress. Sarah's husband, Joel, has disappeared but she refuses to believe he has left her. Alone and desperate, she goes in search of him and meets Hannah who befriends her. As the mystery deepens, she's relieved to find someone to confide in. Meanwhile, Joel is held prisoner in a dark place, subjected to the twisted interrogations of his female captor. Can he convince her to release him? Will Sarah find him before it's too late? With their faith in one another sorely put to the test, their lives hang in the balance.

The reader-player experiences the interactive narrative through the first-person perspectives of both Sarah and Joel, and has to make decisions on their behalf. The choices they make dramatically affect the outcome of the story.
