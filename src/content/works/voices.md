Body dissatisfaction is so common in the western world that it has become the norm, especially among women and girls. 'Voices' is a transdisciplinary research-creation project that aims to address these issues by developing an interactive digital fiction for body image bibliotherapy. I've been creating it with the critical co-design participation of a group of young women and non-binary individuals (aged 18-25) from diverse backgrounds, who are representative of its intended audience.

*Voices* is an outcome of Writing New Body Worlds, an interdisciplinary research project that collaborated with a group of 18-25 year-old women and non-binary individuals from diverse backgrounds to co-design the digital fiction. The branching narrative reflects their experiences and, hopefully, suggests potential strategies for building body image resilience.
